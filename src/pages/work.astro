					experiences are private. These techniques give fast results.

					You will feel more at ease with your internal map of your
					world - your past, present and future - and be relaxed and
					in control. and you will feel able to tackle issues that may
					have been holding you back - from making a choice, a
					difficult decision or a big change in your life.

					Devising easy tweaks that work for Tamara gives focus and
					encouragement that, yes, your body and mind can feel better.
